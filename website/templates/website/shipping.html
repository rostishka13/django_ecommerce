What is the estimated delivery time?
Products are typically dispatched within 1-4 days of order confirmation depending on Your destination and services related to the Product shall be provided after the delivery of the Product. Once the product is dispatched for delivery we will notify you of the same.
All the products are transported and delivered using the Urban Ladder or its partner delivery network.
While we try to ensure that the Product reaches you within the delivery time communicated, exigencies may delay the delivery. In such cases, please do not worry. Get in touch with us for the latest update on your shipment if we have already not got in touch with you.
For pre-orders, the estimated delivery time is 12 - 15 days starting from the day of shipping. The day of shipping is indicated on your product page at the time of order. Please note that we will NOT be able to ship pre-orders earlier than the indicated time.
Are there any shipping charges?
We charge for shipments in certain pincodes. Any additional charges like entry taxes  shall be borne by us. When you enter a pin-code in the address field while ordering a product, the system will indicate whether we charge for shipments to your pin-code or not.
However, if in certain exceptional cases, we agree to deliver the Products in non-serviceable pin-codes, we may deliver the product at your doorstep provided the transportation/shipping cost is borne by you at actuals in advance
How do I track my order?
The best way to check your order status is to sign-up at urbanladder.com and go to the order tracking page: https://www.urbanladder.com/orders. We try our best to deliver your Product before you can even think 'Where is it now?' :) i.e. well within 10 days of your order (or 10 days of the promised shipment date in the case of pre-orders). In a few cases however, we take closer to our promised 12 - 15 days for delivery. In such cases, we proactively call / email the customer to inform them of the status of their product and where it is in transit. In the rare case when you have not received any communication from us for 10 days after order (or 10 days after promised shipment date in the case of pre-orders) do give us a call at our customer care number or email us at hello@urbanladder.com.
What should I check when the product is delivered to me?
Please check for all the following items when the product is delivered to you:
Please check on all external surfaces across the product for any breakages, cracks, chip-offs, unfinished patches, or borer / insect infestations
In case there is some dust or a lack of shine, our team will be able to fix this immediately by applying a coat of wood polish or by rubbing the surface with a cloth; this is an accepted industry-standard method for cleaning the surface / polishing it
For all products that involve assembly, please ensure that the delivery team assembles the product so you are sure that all nuts and bolts are present and they fit well
For all products that require wall installation, kindly decide prior to the delivery team's visit on the exact location in your house where you would want to place your product, and instruct the delivery team to fix the product; please ensure that you have taken all necessary approvals prior for any drilling etc. that may be required to fix wall items in your apartment / home
For all products kept on the floor, ensure that the product stands steady and straight. In case there is an uneven leg (less than 5 mm difference), then our team will install bushes at the foot of that leg to balance the product better; in case the uneven leg is more than 5 mm, then we will take the item back to provide a replacement (or a repair) based on extent of change needed
For all seating products, kindly sit on the item to ensure that the structure is stable with your weight on it
Currently we make sure that the internal areas of storage products are well finished to not have any loose pieces / splinters to hurt your arms; however the extent of polish of internal areas may not match with the extent of polish on external areas
Wood has natural qualities such as differing grain patterns, minimal stain differences and small knots - small knots which structurally don't impact the product will be fully filled with putty and polished to make sure that they don't hamper the product; knots that alter structural stability of the product would be rejected at the quality control stage; differing grain patterns and stain differences are generally acceptable on hard wood products
Hard wood products may expand slightly during the summer months because of which some drawers may get stuck. This is normal, and nothing to be worried about. Reach out to our customer care team with your request, and our after-sales service team will come by and minimise the expansion by sanding the sides of the product.
Once the product is delivered and our delivery team leaves your location, we will be able to only honour manufacturing defects and other fair usage breakages as outlined in the warranty policy.
What if I receive a damaged product?
We work with manufacturers who have highly specialized quality control measures that ensure the product is up to our standards when you receive the product. In case you receive a damaged product (damage as defined above), please bring it to the notice of the delivery personnel immediately. In case you notice an issue later, please write to us at hello@urbanladder.com.
Our team will assess the damage and get back to you within 2 business days. Depending on the degree of damage, we will either repair the product, or offer you a replacement.
Can I cancel the order?
We take great pride in all the designs we create and curate. In the rare case that you do not like the product, or are unable to make space for it, you may cancel the order only in the following cases and in the following manner.
1. Cancellation prior to delivery - You can cancel your order for any product at any time prior to its delivery by logging into your account and selecting the 'Request cancellation' option. For cancellations made before a Delivery Attempt, any advance paid will be refunded as per Urban Ladder’s refunds policy.  However, in case of cancellation of any Made To Order product (“MTO”) within 24 hours of placing the order, a full refund will be initiated. Post the 24-hour window, you will be charged  25% of the order value as a restocking fee.
2. Cancellation at the time of delivery - In case you are unhappy with a product, you may return the same on the spot, at the time of delivery. Cancellation at the time of delivery is not allowed for MTO Products.
3. Cancellation after delivery is not allowed - After delivery of the product, only After Sales services will be applicable, and cancellation is not an option.
Is there a cancellation fee applicable?
We generally do not levy cancellation fees except in the case of Made To Order (MTO) products. In the case of MTO products, if you cancel within 24 hours of placing the order, you will receive a full refund. Post the 24-hour window, you will be charged  25% of the order value as a restocking fee.  Please also note that after delivery of the product, only After Sales services will be applicable, and cancellation is not an option. We do not offer exchanges or cancellations for MTO Products.
NOTE
Once we have delivered the product and left the customer's premises, we will not be able to accommodate any cancellation or replacement requests (other than as covered by the product warranty). We recommend that customers be present at the time of delivery to check for any possible manufacturing defects. Should there be any, please inform the Service Associate. Our delivery staff will assist you with any questions you may have.</p></div>
